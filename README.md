# Presentation Reqriments
## General Reqriments
1. Three things learned in tech
2. Three things learned in core
3. Things you learned in club and/ or elective
4. favorite memory from **this** term
	- **must**, I repeat, **must**
## Notes
1. do more than just a simple description (like name of module)
2. recomendations for haveing high quality over the general slideshow (some specialized sections bellow):
	- Cohen- 1 slide for each
	- Charlie- high quality slides. If you want to put all points on 1 slide, make up for the decrease in slide numbers (and, to be fair, decrease in space you can use) via a more interesting, high quality slide.
	- the easiest way: "hybrid", or using parts from all of them
3. don't use it as notes per-say. The points should have at least some content, if needed use presenter notes for reminders
	- for instance, don't just put "I learned about parts of computers". If that's enough of a note to yourself, put that into presenter notes. The main presentation should, while not haveing a block of text, have at least some more
	- I recommend about 1 to 2 sentences (or a bulleted list with details.
4. use lots of images:
	- I suggest you use at least 2 images that are related to the content, and/or 3 pictures (one for each point)
	- if you have multiple different, but related, points on a slide, consider a picture that is either related to how they are similar
		- so if it was about, say, finding a job and how you should act at work. Either 2 pictures, one for each, or 1 picture that is about the commonality (maybe how you should act at an interview, as that's finding a job and work) picture related to though
	- do be careful to not make it too busy, and be sparing with unrelated decorative images. Some are fine, but depending on use, they can cause the opposite effect as intended
